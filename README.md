| Metric                             | Baseline   | Kognitos   | Improvement |
|------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| **ðŸš¨ Error Rate**                  | 8.1%       | 0.9%       | **88.9**    |
| **Cost per Invoice**               | $10.03     | $3.02      | **69.9%**   |
| **Processing Time**                | 12.08 mins | 1.99 mins  | **83.5%**   |
| **End-to-end Cycle Time (days)**   | 10.0       | 3.5        | **65.0%**   |
| **Annual Savings**                 | -          | $32M (see report) | $32M |

## ðŸ’° The Business Case

**Transform AP operations with English-as-code automation:**

â€¢ **ðŸš¨ $25.2M annual error cost avoidance** ($350 avg per error)  
â€¢ **88.9% fewer errors** with self-healing workflows  
â€¢ **69.9% cost reduction** with consumption-based pricing  
â€¢ **83.5% faster processing** with neurosymbolic AI  
â€¢ **Zero hallucinations** â€“ verifiable results for increased trust and compliance.  
â€¢ **Tamper-proof audit trails** for bulletproof governance.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Kognitos Wins

**vs. Traditional RPA:** Self-healing vs. brittle workflows  
**vs. LLM-only:** Hallucination-free vs. unreliable outputs  
**vs. Custom Dev:** English-as-code vs. expensive technical resources

## ðŸ”§ What You'll See

â€¢ **1000 real-world invoices** (including 15% 'monster' invoices designed to stress-test robustness and self-healing).  
â€¢ **Realistic cost model** using actual AP clerk and machine rates  
â€¢ **Scaled time model** â€“ `processing.py` simulates real-world processing times in minutes; 1 demo second = 100 real-world hours for enterprise *cost projection and comparison*.  
â€¢ **Cryptographic audit trail** with SHA-256 Merkle roots  
â€¢ **Production-ready results** simulating enterprise scenarios

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Pilot on 10K live invoices** â†’ Validate multi-million dollar potential net annual benefits (see report for exact figures).  
2. **Review audit trail** â†’ Verify cryptographic proof  
3. **Customize workflows** â†’ Modify English-as-code instructions  
4. **Scale to production** â†’ Deploy with consumption-based pricing
